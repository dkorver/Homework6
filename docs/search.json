Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = “kendall”) on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (I’m really trying to ask you how you specify method = “kendall” when calling lapply()).\n\n\nFill in later\n\n\nWhat are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?\n\n\nFill in later\n\n\nWhat is a side-effect function?\n\n\nFill in later\n\n\nWhy can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?\n\n\nFill in later\n\n\n\nTask 2 - Writing R Functions\n\n\nTask 3 - Querying an API and a Tidy-Style Function"
